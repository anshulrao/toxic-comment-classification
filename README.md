# Toxic Comment Classification


## Summary

Implemented two multi-label classification models namely Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. 
The MNB model produced an accuracy of 86 percent on the test data and hamming loss of 0.031 whereas the LSTM model produced an accuracy of 99 percent on the test data and loss of 0.259.
